# telluricpy
A collection of python classes, functions and scripts for working with earth models in python.

Uses numpy, scipy and vtk to process and import data files in to vtk format.
Also leverages SimPEG (www.simpeg.xyz) for discretization.

Support for some geophysical model and data files (files I work with)
  - UBC model files
  - ARCGIS files
  - VTK files
into vtk objects.

Some plotting functions are provided as well.

This package are collections of functions I have needed to make for my work and PhD. I hope these can
help others to improve there workflows and make work with earth models more pleant.

Please don't hestitate to contact me with questions or comments, and post issues.
